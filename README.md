# NEWCARE 4K 60Hz 4x2 Remote-Codes
This repository contains the NEC Codes for the NEWCARE 4K@60Hz 4x2 Remote Control Codes

These codes were derived directly from the included remote using an ESP32 and IR reciever.

The trasmitter.yaml is an example showing how to use these codes via EspHome (using a NodeMCU ESP32). Using EspHome is probably the simpliest way to automate this type of switch or other ir capable device via Home Assistant.
