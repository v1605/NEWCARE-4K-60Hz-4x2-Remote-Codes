# NEWCARE 4K 60Hz 4x2 Remote-Codes
This repository contains the NEC Codes for the NEWCARE 4K@60Hz 4x2 Remote Control Codes

These codes were derived directly from the included remote using an ESP32 and a 5v, 3pin IR reciever (eg 1838 module https://www.amazon.com/Gikfun-Digital-Receiver-Transmitter-Arduino/dp/B0816P2545). The sample code is provided in the reciever.yaml.

The trasmitter.yaml is an example showing how to use these codes via EspHome (using a NodeMCU ESP32 and 2 pin IR led). Using EspHome is probably the simpliest way to automate this type of switch or other ir capable device via Home Assistant.
